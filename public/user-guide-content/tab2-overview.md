# Tab 2: Market Overview

## Overview
The Market Overview tab provides a comprehensive **multi-market screening simultaneously across all your locations**. This powerful analysis identifies which geographic markets may raise competitive concerns based on market share and concentration thresholds.

**Key Capability**: Analyzes all overlapping markets at once, giving you a complete competitive landscape view.

## Critical Analysis Flow

### The Three-Stage Logic
The Market Overview follows this critical progression:

1. **ALL MARKETS** → Identifies all geographic markets around your locations
2. **OVERLAPPING MARKETS** → Filters to markets where both merger parties are present (competitive overlap)
3. **PROBLEMATIC MARKETS** → Flags those exceeding regulatory thresholds

**IMPORTANT**: Tab 2 displays **ALL overlapping markets**, not just problematic ones. This complete view is essential for understanding the full competitive landscape.

## Relevant Geographic Market

Tab 2 allows the user to investigate the degree of party competitive overlap, and estimate competitive metrics, under three geographic market definition methods: 

1. **Distance Radius**: Fixed radius circles (e.g., 5km, 10km)
2. **Travel Time Isochrone**: Areas reachable within a certain drive time (e.g., 15 minutes)
3. **Census Boundaries**: All CMAs, CAs, and CBDs from the most recent census.

Methods 1 and 2 create geographic markets around each location in the data, and method 3 analyzes all census boundaries where the parties both have a presence (more advanced methods of market definition are available in Tab 3):

# Step 1: Configuring Your Analysis

## Select Market Centers and Market Definition Method

- **Specify Market Centers**: analyze markets defined around Purchaser locations, Target locations only, or both.
- **Specify Boundary Method**:

**Distance Radius**
- Simple circular markets
- Choose from preset distances (2km, 5km, 10km, 15km, 20km)
- Best for urban areas with uniform density

**Travel Time** (requires Mapbox API)
- Realistic drive-time boundaries
- Accounts for roads, traffic patterns, and barriers
- More accurate for suburban/rural areas

**Census Boundaries**:
- Searches all census boundaries (CMA, CA and CSD) for overlap between the parties
- Full search takes ~40 seconds per ten locations
- Users can limit searches to specific census boundary catgegories to increase search efficiency

The system automatically flags markets that exceed:
- **Market Share**: Combined share > 30%
- **HHI Threshold**: HHI > 1800 AND ΔHHI > 100

These thresholds can be customized in Tab 5: Settings.

# Step 2: Analyze Markets

After configuring market definition and market centers, press "Analyze Markets"

## Understanding the Results

### Interactive Map

**Map Display**: The map displays all analyzed markets with grey market boundaries
- Note: map display shows all market boundaries, not just overlapping markets

![See overview map of all market boundaries](/user-guide-content/tab2-map.png)

### Results Table

The top table shows detailed metrics for each market, according to the geographic market definition provided above.

## Filtered Results

The app provides a bar chart summarizing market shares, and below that, the user can view filtered results in greater detail:

# Step 3: Save Results

### Export Options

- **Analysis Tables**: All analysis conducted on Tab 2 is saved and made available for inclusion in the Excel report, generated by the user on Tab 5 (see Tab 5)
- **Map Images**: Native map export function coming soon: use the screenshot function of your PC to save map images

## Performance Optimization

### Dataset Capacity
- **Handles up to 10,000+ locations** comfortably

### Performance Expectations
- **< 100 locations**: Near-instant results
- **100-1,000 locations**: 1-5 minutes
- **1,000-5,000 locations**: 5-15 minutes
- **5,000-10,000 locations**: 15-40 minutes

### Drive Time Isochrones
- **Processing Time**: For datasets with many Party locations included in the multimarket analysis, drive-time catchments are retrieved from Mapbox at a rate of about 400/minute

### Next Steps for Problematic Markets
1. Run automated screening with Market X-Ray (Tab 3)
2. Review individual markets in detail (Tab 4)
3. Consider potential remedies (Tab 5)
4. Prepare regulatory filings with supporting data

## Best Practices

- **Start Broad**: Begin with larger radius/time to identify all potential issues
- **Refine Analysis**: Narrow down to realistic market definitions
- **Document Rationale**: Save your market definition choices for regulatory submissions
- **Consider Local Factors**: Some markets may need individual adjustment in individual market analysis (Tab 3)
- **Save Your Work**: Save and export analysis when working with large datasets
- **Batch Process Large Datasets**: For large datasets that can be divided by region (e.g., by province) conduct the analysis in segments

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I analyze different radius for different markets?**
A: Yes, use Tab 3 for individual market analysis with custom parameters.

**Q: How accurate are travel-time isochrones?**
A: They reflect typical traffic conditions and are generally within 10-15% of actual drive times.
