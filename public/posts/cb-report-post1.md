The Competition Bureau's 2024-25 Annual Report showcased a year of enforcement milestones: 253 merger reviews, $42.3 million in penalties, and three consent agreements that redefined how Canada analyzes market power. But buried in the report's description of the Digital Enforcement and Intelligence Branch was a disclosure that should make every deal team pay attention.

The Bureau has built sophisticated geospatial analysis tools. And they're using them to dissect local markets with surgical precision.

The evidence is in the results. When the Competition Bureau approved Bell Media's $410 million acquisition of Outedge in 2024, Bell kept 93% of the assets. The other 7%—exactly 669 advertising displays—had to be sold. Why those specific billboards? Because of market share and HHI thresholds in relevant geographic markets that the Bureau has defined by a variety of small local catchments, across the metro areas where the merging parties had competitive overlap.

The same pattern played out in Alberta's electricity market and Saskatchewan's building materials sector. Three completely different industries. Three consent agreements. One common thread: **geographic market definition determined everything.**

The Annual Report revealed why: the Bureau's Digital Enforcement and Intelligence Branch developed an "Eagle Eye tool" that "helps teams analyze local markets by showing how much market share businesses hold in different areas." The question for merging parties is whether they have the same capability.

## Three Cases, One Analytical Framework

### Bell/Outedge: The 5-City Solution

Bell acquired 9,325 outdoor advertising displays across Canada. The Bureau's concern wasn't national market share—it was local market power in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke, Greater Montreal, and Greater Toronto.

The Bureau's analysis was precise: competition concerns arose in "geographic areas no larger than a census metropolitan area (CMA), and likely smaller areas within a CMA." The key finding? Bell and Outedge "vigorously competed" in these markets where "strict by-laws and lengthy permitting processes" could block potential new entrants. Municipal regulation created natural market boundaries.

The remedy matched the analysis: 669 displays divested in problem markets; 8,656 retained elsewhere. The Bureau required "sufficient diversity of outdoor advertising assets" in the divestiture package—not just any displays, but the right mix to enable effective competition.

### TransAlta/Heartland: When Geography Meets Time

TransAlta's acquisition of Heartland Generation added a critical dimension: **when** competition occurs matters as much as **where**.

The Bureau found competitive harm in Alberta's wholesale electricity market "particularly during peak demand periods"—specifically summer super-peak hours, winter super-peak hours, winter peak hours, and winter off-peak hours. The merged entity may be able to engage in "economic withholding" during critical hours when renewable generating capacity was unavailable, raising wholesale prices to benefit the rest of TransAlta's portfolio.

The remedy: three power generation facilities (Poplar Hill and Rainbow Lake) sold to independent purchasers, precisely calibrated to preserve competition during high-demand windows.

### RONA/All-Fab: Testing the Boundaries

RONA's acquisition of All-Fab came down to one geographic market: the "Saskatoon area" for roof and floor trusses.

The Bureau's analysis tested multiple scenarios—"markets as narrow as the city of Saskatoon and as broad as the province of Saskatchewan." Why Saskatoon? Because trusses are bulky, low-value products with high transportation costs relative to price. The relevant competitive constraint is how far a customer will travel for trusses.

This case triggered Bill C-59's new structural presumption: the acquisition was "presumptively anti-competitive in the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan area as it would result in a significant increase in market concentration." The Bureau required divestiture of one manufacturing facility in Martensville to preserve local competition.

## The New Analytical Standard

Here's what the Bureau's 2024-25 Annual Report disclosed: their Digital Enforcement and Intelligence Branch developed an "Eagle Eye tool" that "helps teams analyze local markets by showing how much market share businesses hold in different areas."

The Bureau isn't guessing about geographic markets anymore. They're using geospatial analysis and automated market boundary testing to evaluate every scenario.

This changes the strategic equation for merger review. When Bill C-59's structural presumptions apply—HHI increases above 100 points **and** market shares exceed 30%—the burden shifts to merging parties to prove the merger won't harm competition. Geographic boundaries determine whether you hit those thresholds.

In Bell's case, national market share was irrelevant. What mattered was their share in Trois-Rivières. In RONA's case, having competitors in Edmonton didn't help when the relevant market was Saskatoon.

## The Tactical Reality

Bell's deal took approximately eight months from announcement to consent agreement. During that time, the parties needed to:

1. Model multiple geographic market scenarios
2. Calculate market shares and HHI for each scenario
3. Identify which combinations triggered structural presumptions  
4. Propose surgical remedies that addressed concerns without killing the deal

Traditional economic consulting follows a linear path: define preliminary markets (weeks 1-4), test alternatives (weeks 5-12), respond to Bureau questions (weeks 13-20), design remedies (weeks 21-30). That's 30 weeks if everything goes smoothly.

**The parties who model 10+ market definitions before announcing the deal control the negotiation timeline.** They arrive at the Bureau with defensible boundaries and pre-identified divestiture candidates. They turn a 30-week firefight into a structured discussion.

## What This Means for 2025

The Bureau reviewed 253 mergers in 2024-25 and secured three consent agreements—all driven by precise geographic market analysis. They appointed Dr. Heski Bar-Isaac as Special Economic Advisor for Digital Markets and are expanding their data science capabilities.

When the Bureau updates its Merger Enforcement Guidelines in 2025, expect explicit guidance on modeling structural presumptions across geographic scenarios. The analytical sophistication demonstrated in Bell, TransAlta, and RONA cases is now the expected standard.

## The Bottom Line

Three consent agreements. Three different industries. One lesson: **geographic market definition isn't just an analytical step—it's the strategic chokepoint of modern merger review.**

The Bureau found harm in 5 specific CMAs out of dozens where Bell and Outedge overlapped. They identified peak demand periods in Alberta's electricity market. They defined competition boundaries around Saskatoon for building materials.

None of these cases turned on national market share or abstract economic theory. They turned on precise, defensible answers to one question: *Where does competition actually happen?*

If the Bureau has tools to test markets "as narrow as the city of Saskatoon and as broad as the province of Saskatchewan," merging parties need the same capability. The ability to model multiple market scenarios comprehensively—and quickly—isn't a competitive advantage anymore.

It's table stakes.
