## How an Econ Knowledge Graph Helps Competition Lawyers

### The recurring challenge

Competition lawyers know the feeling: you’ve gathered strong evidence—market shares, HHI calculations, pricing data, expert analysis—but when it comes time to draft a memo or persuade the Bureau, you still need to anchor it in an **authoritative proposition**. That is, a clear, citable statement from a trusted source—whether a leading article, a Tribunal decision, or a Bureau study—that directly supports your argument.  

Finding that proposition can be **slow, stressful, and a real bottleneck**. The hours may be billable, but the opportunity cost is high: energy is spent hunting for the right authority instead of sharpening the argument.  

An **econ knowledge graph** is designed to solve exactly this problem. By building a machine-readable database of propositions, citations, and evidence from the academic literature and other sources, Dex puts critical economic arguments at the fingertips of competition lawyers, with the power of AI.

### What is a knowledge graph?

A knowledge graph is a structured way of storing information so that **authoritative propositions are easy to find and connect**.  

In the competition law context, it organizes:  

- **Works**: articles, cases, reports.  
- **Propositions**: one-sentence authoritative claims drawn from those works.  
- **Fragments**: the exact quotes, tables, or charts that support each claim.  
- **Edges**: links that show whether claims support, contradict, or cite each other.  

The result is a clear, searchable map of authoritative evidence—built for legal use and defensible in practice.

### Why this matters in Canadian competition law

The landscape has shifted. The 2024 amendments brought stricter merger thresholds, repealed the efficiencies defence, and raised the standard for remedies. Wage-fixing and no-poach agreements are now criminal offences. And the Bureau is leaning heavily on market studies in groceries and airlines.  

Each development is accompanied by a **flood of new guidance, cases, and economic commentary**, making it harder than ever to locate the right authoritative proposition at the right time. A knowledge graph cuts through that noise and puts the evidence at your fingertips.

### How lawyers use it

- **Memos and submissions**  
  *Before*: bottlenecks—skimming dozens of PDFs to locate one authoritative proposition.  
  *After*: query the graph and receive precise propositions, each with a pinpoint citation, ready to be cited.  

- **Expert reports**  
  *Before*: back-and-forth with economists, slowed by the search for agreed-upon propositions.  
  *After*: both legal and economic teams work from the same verified set of authoritative propositions, aligned from the start.  

- **Cross-jurisdiction comparisons**  
  *Before*: time-consuming manual research across Canadian, U.S., and EU sources.  
  *After*: Tribunal decisions, Bureau guidance, and global scholarship are linked by relationships like *supports* and *contradicts*, showing immediately how authoritative propositions travel across jurisdictions.  

- **Policy advocacy**  
  *Before*: days spent compiling sources to demonstrate consensus or disagreement.  
  *After*: the graph instantly surfaces where authoritative propositions converge—or split—so counsel can focus on advocacy, not information gathering.

### The AI advantage

Because the graph is structured, AI doesn't just index documents—it **organizes authoritative propositions by claim**.  

- **Ingestion**: monitors new cases, studies, and papers, proposing new propositions for review.  
- **Index by claim, not keyword**: lets lawyers ask natural questions and receive authoritative answers.  
- **Strategic flagging**: highlights contradictions or replication failures, reducing the risk of relying on contested propositions and allowing counsel to preempt opposing arguments.  

The result is a **living library of authoritative economic propositions**, always current and always defensible.

### Closing

Canadian competition law is evolving quickly, and the information load is only growing. The firms that succeed will be those that can surface authoritative propositions at speed, with confidence in their sources.  

An econ knowledge graph doesn’t replace legal judgment—it **amplifies it**. By turning sprawling research into a map of citable evidence, it ensures that the next time you need support for your argument, the right authoritative proposition is only one query away.
