Recent amendments to the _Competition Act_ have introduced a new structural presumption: a merger is now presumed to be anti-competitive if it results in a market share above 30%. This change has created significant legal jeopardy for large companies, forcing legal teams to confront complex market share calculations at the earliest stages of a transaction. The problem is, the traditional tools for this analysis are anything but early-stage friendly.

How often has a critical strategic question been raised in a meeting—"What if we define the market this way instead?" or "What happens if we exclude this competitor?"—only for the answer to be, "We'll have to ask the economists and get back to you in two weeks"? This is the quantitative bottleneck, and it forces legal teams to make crucial decisions based on incomplete information while the clock is ticking.

## The Old Workflow: From Kick-Off Call to Static PDF
The traditional process for quantitative analysis is a linear, multi-week hand-off that is fundamentally misaligned with the dynamic needs of a legal team.

• **Week 1:** The process begins with an initial meeting with external consultants, followed by the slow and careful transfer of sensitive data.

• **Week 2:** The consultants run the primary analysis based on the initial instructions, working in isolation.

• **Week 3:** A 50-page, static PDF report is delivered.

The problem with this model is that it treats the legal team as a passive recipient of information. There is no opportunity to interact with the evidence, test alternative scenarios, or explore new hypotheses without restarting the entire expensive and time-consuming cycle.

## The New Workflow: From Passive Recipient to Active Analyst

Imagine a different approach. Your entire case team is in a boardroom (or a virtual meeting), and on the screen is a live, interactive model of the market.

A junior associate suggests testing a 15-minute drive-time catchment area instead of a simple 5km circle. You drag a slider. Instantly, the market shares and HHI calculations on the screen update. A partner asks to see the impact of excluding a specific competitor from the analysis. You click their location on the map, and the numbers recalculate again.

In a single, two-hour working session, your team can test a dozen different scenarios, pressure-test the other side's likely arguments, and arrive at a robust, data-driven strategy. You haven't just received a report; you have interacted directly with the evidence.

## The Strategic Impact: Better Answers, Not Just Faster Ones

This new, interactive workflow is about more than just speed; it's about achieving a superior strategic outcome.

• **It Leads to Better Arguments:** The ability to iterate and test hypotheses in real-time allows you to discover the strongest possible analytical narrative for your case, instead of being limited by the conventional analytical tools at your disposal.

• **It Empowers Your Team:** It transforms junior associates from project managers into active analysts, deepening their understanding of the file and fostering a more data-literate culture.

• **It Transforms the Client Conversation:** It allows you to advise clients with a level of data-driven confidence and clarity that was previously impossible in the early, critical stages of a file.

The era of waiting for static answers is over. The future of competition analysis is a live, collaborative working session that puts the legal team back in control.
