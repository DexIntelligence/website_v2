# Cookie-Based Authentication Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Cookie-only approach implemented  
**Important**: URL parameters do NOT work in production due to Cloud Run limitations

## ‚ö° Quick Reference for Website Team

**What you need to do**: Set a cookie before redirecting to the app.
**Cookie name**: `market_mapper_token`
**Cookie domain**: `.dexintelligence.ai` (with leading dot)
**Then redirect to**: `https://app.dexintelligence.ai` (no URL params)

## üéØ Current Implementation

### What the Website Does

When a user clicks "Launch Market Mapper" in the dashboard:

1. **Generates secure JWT token** via Netlify function
2. **Sets cookie** with proper cross-subdomain configuration
3. **Redirects** to app.dexintelligence.ai (NO token in URL)

### Code Flow (Dashboard.jsx)

```javascript
const launchMarketMapper = async () => {
  // 1. Get current user and session
  const currentUser = await authService.getUser();
  const session = await authService.getSession();
  
  // 2. Generate secure token via Netlify function
  const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/generate-market-mapper-token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`,
    },
  });
  
  const { token } = await response.json();
  
  // 3. Set cookie with proper domain configuration
  document.cookie = `market_mapper_token=${token}; ` +
                   `domain=.dexintelligence.ai; ` +  // Leading dot for subdomains
                   `path=/; ` +
                   `secure; ` +                       // HTTPS only
                   `samesite=lax; ` +                 // Allow cross-subdomain
                   `max-age=3600`;                    // 1 hour
  
  // 4. Redirect (NO token in URL)
  window.location.href = 'https://app.dexintelligence.ai';
};
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Token & Session Management

### Token Expiry Times
- **JWT Token**: 2 minutes (120000 ms) - short-lived for security
- **Cookie**: 1 hour (3600 seconds) - allows multiple app refreshes
- **App Session**: Persists as long as cookie is valid

### Why Different Expiry Times?
- **Short JWT** (2 min): Minimizes risk if token is intercepted
- **Longer Cookie** (1 hour): User doesn't need to re-authenticate frequently
- **Validation**: App re-validates on each page load, ensuring token is still valid

### Session Refresh Flow
1. User accesses app ‚Üí Cookie read ‚Üí Token validated
2. If token expired but cookie valid ‚Üí Website should generate new token
3. If cookie expired ‚Üí User must return to dashboard

## üç™ Cookie Configuration

### Required Settings
- **domain**: `.dexintelligence.ai` (leading dot is CRITICAL)
- **secure**: `true` (HTTPS only)
- **samesite**: `lax` (allows cross-subdomain)
- **max-age**: `3600` (1 hour)
- **path**: `/` (available to all paths)

### Why These Settings Matter
- **Leading dot** (`.dexintelligence.ai`) makes cookie available to all subdomains
- **SameSite=Lax** (not Strict) allows cookie to be sent on redirect
- **Secure flag** ensures HTTPS-only transmission
- **Max-age** provides automatic cleanup

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå Don't Use URL Parameters
```javascript
// THIS WILL NOT WORK IN PRODUCTION
window.location.href = `https://app.dexintelligence.ai?token=${token}`;
```
Cloud Run strips query parameters - they never reach the app.

### ‚ùå Don't Use localStorage/State Exchange
The state exchange pattern was removed because:
- Added unnecessary complexity
- Browser storage access caused Streamlit errors
- Cookies are more reliable in Cloud Run

### ‚ùå Don't Use SameSite=Strict
```javascript
// THIS BLOCKS CROSS-SUBDOMAIN COOKIES
document.cookie = `token=${token}; samesite=strict`; // Won't work
```

## ‚úÖ What the App Receives

When the app loads at `app.dexintelligence.ai`:
- **Cookie**: `market_mapper_token` is available
- **URL**: Clean, no parameters
- **Validation**: App validates token with website API

### App-Side Cookie Reading (Streamlit)
```python
# auth_handler.py - try_shared_cookie()
from streamlit_cookies_controller import CookieController
cookies = CookieController()
token = cookies.get('market_mapper_token')

if token:
    # Validate with website API
    response = requests.post(
        'https://dexintelligence.ai/.netlify/functions/validate-token',
        json={'token': token},
        headers={'Origin': 'https://app.dexintelligence.ai'}  # Required!
    )
```

**Note**: The `Origin` header is REQUIRED for validation to work.

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Authentication Required" despite setting cookie
**Cause**: Cookie domain doesn't have leading dot
**Fix**: Ensure domain is `.dexintelligence.ai` not `dexintelligence.ai`

### Issue: Token validation returns 401/403
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect Origin header
**Fix**: App must send `Origin: https://app.dexintelligence.ai` header

### Issue: Cookie not visible in app
**Cause**: SameSite set to Strict instead of Lax
**Fix**: Use `samesite=lax` to allow cross-subdomain

### Issue: Works locally but not in production
**Cause**: Trying to use URL parameters
**Fix**: URL params don't work in Cloud Run - use cookies only

## üß™ Testing

### Verify Cookie is Set
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
2. Look for `dexintelligence.ai` domain
3. Should see `market_mapper_token` cookie
4. Check domain has leading dot: `.dexintelligence.ai`

### Test Authentication Flow
1. Login to dashboard
2. Click "Launch Market Mapper"
3. App should authenticate automatically
4. No URL parameters should be visible

## üìÅ Files Changed

### Updated Files
- `src/pages/client/Dashboard.jsx` - Simplified to cookie-only approach
  - Sets cookie with proper domain configuration
  - Redirects WITHOUT token in URL
  - Added debug logging for verification
- `src/utils/auth.js` - Removed URL token code
  - Deleted `buildAppUrl` function that was adding tokens to URLs
  - Kept only essential auth methods

### Files Deleted (No Longer Needed)
- ‚úÖ `src/utils/authState.js` - Was orphaned, not imported anywhere
- ‚úÖ `netlify/functions/create-auth-state.js` - State exchange not used
- ‚úÖ `netlify/functions/exchange-state.js` - State exchange not used  
- ‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/` - No database tables needed for cookies
- ‚úÖ Test files for state exchange
- ‚úÖ Old documentation files for state exchange pattern

## ‚úÖ Code Review Verification

**Consistency Check Results:**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard.jsx only sets cookies, no URL tokens
- ‚úÖ auth.js has no buildAppUrl or URL token functions
- ‚úÖ authState.js is orphaned (not imported anywhere)
- ‚úÖ No redirects include `?token=` parameters
- ‚úÖ All `window.location.href` assignments use clean URLs
- ‚úÖ No localStorage operations for auth tokens
- ‚úÖ Cookie domain has leading dot: `.dexintelligence.ai`
- ‚úÖ Cookie uses `samesite=lax` for cross-subdomain

## üîß Environment Variables Required

### Website (Netlify Functions)
- `JWT_SECRET` - For signing tokens
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

### App (Cloud Run)
- **None required for authentication!**
- Authentication is stateless via cookie validation
- No JWT_SECRET needed on app side (validation done by website API)

### NOT Required Anymore
- ~~SUPABASE_URL~~ (state exchange removed)
- ~~SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY~~ (state exchange removed)
- ~~SUPABASE_ANON_KEY~~ (state exchange removed)

## üìä Summary

| Method | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Cookie Authentication | ‚úÖ WORKING | Only method that works in production |
| URL Parameters | ‚ùå REMOVED | Stripped by Cloud Run |
| State Exchange | ‚ùå REMOVED | Unnecessary complexity |
| localStorage | ‚ùå REMOVED | Caused Streamlit errors |

## üöÄ Production Ready

The implementation is:
- **Simple**: One cookie, one redirect
- **Secure**: Proper cookie flags and JWT signing
- **Reliable**: Works in Cloud Run environment
- **Clean**: No unnecessary complexity

### Deployment Checklist

**Website Team**:
- [ ] Cookie domain has leading dot: `.dexintelligence.ai`
- [ ] Cookie has `samesite=lax` (not strict)
- [ ] Cookie has `secure=true` for HTTPS
- [ ] Redirect URL has no query parameters
- [ ] JWT token includes userId, email, exp claims
- [ ] Removed `buildAppUrl` function that adds tokens to URLs
- [ ] No token in redirect URL

**App Team**:
- [ ] Using `streamlit-cookies-controller` package
- [ ] Sending `Origin` header with validation requests
- [ ] NOT checking URL parameters for tokens
- [ ] Cookie name matches: `market_mapper_token`

## üêõ Debugging Cookie Issues

### Changes Made (2025-01-28)

1. **Added Debug Logging** to Dashboard.jsx:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Setting cookie:', cookieString);
   console.log('All cookies after setting:', document.cookie);
   console.log('Redirecting to: https://app.dexintelligence.ai (no token in URL)');
   ```

2. **Removed URL Token Code** from auth.js:
   - Deleted `buildAppUrl` function that was adding `?token=` to URLs
   - This was causing tokens to appear in URLs even though Dashboard wasn't using it

### Testing Cookie Setting

1. **Clear Everything First:**
   - Clear all cookies for dexintelligence.ai
   - Clear localStorage
   - Log out and log back in

2. **Check Console Output:**
   When clicking "Launch Market Mapper", console should show:
   ```
   Setting cookie: market_mapper_token=eyJ...
   All cookies after setting: market_mapper_token=eyJ...
   Redirecting to: https://app.dexintelligence.ai (no token in URL)
   ```

3. **Verify in DevTools:**
   - Go to Application ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí dexintelligence.ai
   - Should see `market_mapper_token` with domain `.dexintelligence.ai`

### If Cookie Is NOT Being Set

**Test in Console:**
```javascript
// Test if cookies work at all
document.cookie = "test=value; domain=.dexintelligence.ai; path=/";
console.log('Cookies:', document.cookie);

// Check secure context (required for secure cookies)
console.log('Secure context?', window.isSecureContext);

// Check current domain
console.log('Domain:', window.location.hostname);
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Not HTTPS**: Secure cookies only work on HTTPS (not http://localhost)
- **Domain mismatch**: Must be on dexintelligence.ai domain
- **Browser blocking**: Check cookie settings, try incognito mode
- **Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cached JS

### If Token Still Appears in URL

1. **Check for cached code** - Hard refresh browser
2. **Search for other redirects** - Look for any code with `?token=`
3. **Verify deployment** - Ensure latest code is deployed
4. **Check browser network tab** - See if redirect has token

The website now does exactly what's needed for the app team's cookie-based authentication!
