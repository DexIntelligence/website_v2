# Market Mapper - Antitrust Analysis Tool

A web application for geographic market analysis in competition law cases, focusing on merger impact assessment and regulatory compliance.

## Status

✅ **Production Ready** - Stable build with 92.3% bug resolution rate  
✅ **Enhanced Multi-Location Analysis** - New connectivity validation features  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - All critical and high-priority issues resolved

## Features

- **Geographic Market Analysis**: Define markets using distance radius, travel-time isochrones, or Canadian census boundaries
- **Multi-Location Analysis**: Combined catchment analysis using union or intersection operations
- **Multi-Market Screening**: Analyze all overlapping markets simultaneously  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automatic flagging based on HHI and market share thresholds
- **Divestiture Optimization**: Calculate minimum divestitures to meet regulatory requirements
- **Excel Reporting**: Professional reports with methodology appendices
- **Pre-Geocoded Data Support**: Direct coordinate upload bypassing geocoding workflow
- **Deterministic Coordinate Spreading**: Golden-angle spiral algorithm for duplicate coordinate visualization

## Performance

After recent optimizations:
- **Memory Usage**: 453 MB peak for 3000 locations (78% reduction)
- **Container Requirements**: 2-3 GB (down from 4-6 GB)
- **Dataset Capacity**: Handles up to 5,000 locations comfortably

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd market-mapper

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export MAPBOX_API_KEY="pk.your-public-token-here"
export MAPBOX_SECRET_KEY="sk.your-secret-token-here"

# Run application
streamlit run app.py
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t market-mapper:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  -e MAPBOX_API_KEY="pk.your-public-token" \
  -e MAPBOX_SECRET_KEY="sk.your-secret-token" \
  --memory="2g" \
  market-mapper:latest
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8501`

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- 2 GB RAM
- Mapbox API key (for travel-time analysis)

### Recommended for Production
- 3 GB RAM (handles up to 10,000 locations)
- AWS ECS Fargate or similar container service
- CloudFront CDN for static assets

## Application Workflow

### Tab 1: Upload Data
- Upload Excel file with retailer locations
- Map columns (location, address, competitor, economic value)
- Identify purchaser and target brands
- Geocode addresses (multiple service fallbacks)
- Deterministic coordinate spreading for duplicate locations

### Tab 2: Market Overview
- Multi-market analysis across all locations
- Distance radius or travel-time isochrone markets
- Automatic regulatory threshold screening
- Interactive map visualization

### Tab 3: Individual Market Analysis
- Detailed single-location market analysis
- Three market definition methods: distance radius, travel-time isochrones, census boundaries
- Census boundary support for Canadian districts (CMAs, CAs, CSDs)
- Market share and HHI calculations
- Pre/post merger concentration metrics

### Tab 4: Optimal Divestiture Analysis
- Mixed-integer programming optimization
- Crown jewel constraints
- Minimum divestiture calculation
- Market-by-market remedy breakdown

### Tab 5: Settings & Export
- Configure regulatory thresholds
- Generate Excel reports
- Export analysis results

## Memory Management

The application includes built-in memory optimization:
- **Real-time monitoring**: Memory usage displayed in sidebar
- **Automatic cleanup**: Garbage collection after major operations
- **User controls**: "Clear Analysis Data" button when memory > 500 MB
- **Efficient operations**: Optimized DataFrame handling

## API Configuration

### Mapbox API (Required for Travel-Time Analysis)
1. Sign up at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
2. Create two tokens:
   - **Public token** (starts with `pk.`): Map display
   - **Secret token** (starts with `sk.`): Server-side isochrone API
3. Set environment variables:
   - `MAPBOX_API_KEY=pk.your-public-token`
   - `MAPBOX_SECRET_KEY=sk.your-secret-token`

Rate limit: 300 requests/minute

## Deployment Options

### Simple Deployment (Recommended to Start)
- Use `deployment/aws/ecs-task-definition-simple.json`
- 2 GB memory allocation
- In-memory session state
- Single instance

### Scaled Deployment (When Needed)
- Infrastructure ready for Redis session state
- Async processing for large datasets
- Just change environment variables to enable
